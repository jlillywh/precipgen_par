# PrecipGen Parameter Generator

## 1. Introduction
The `PrecipGenPAR` program produces the input parameters needed to run a stochastic precipitation simulator called "PrecipGen." PrecipGen is a first-order, 2-state Markov chain-gamma model that simulates daily precipitation for a long-term simulation at a single point on the earth. A Markov process models the change between 2 states (wet vs dry) randomly over time and the probability of a state change depends on the previous state. Precipitation rate is modeled by sampling from a gamma probability distribution. Leveraging the foundational work of Dee Allen Wright and the WGEN model from 1983, implemented in FORTRAN, this program inherits a legacy of reliability in precipitation simulation. This implementation has the added option to incorporate long-term cyclic behavior, based correlations found in the historical record.

## 2. Design
The system consists of two main components: the Parameter Calculator "PrecipGenPAR" and the Precipitation Simulator "PrecipGen".

### 2.1 PrecipGenPAR
Reads long-term historical record and calculates four parameters for each month. It also calculates these parameters based on identified dry and deluge periods (long-term capability is phase 2).

#### 2.2 PrecipGen
This component runs a simulation using the precip generator, a Markov chain model, with the parameters provided by the Parameter Calculator. In phase 2, incorporate long-term logic.

## 3. Getting Started
The workflow for using the `PrecipGen` project involves several steps:

### 3.1 Establish the Time Series (Not Included in Design)
The first step is to establish a time series of daily precipitation totals over a long-term history. This data can usually be downloaded from the NOAA NCEI webpage. Ensure that the data is clean and ready to be used, and follows our requirements for the time series. Assume this is done outside of PrecipGen!

### 3.2 Fill Missing Data (RECOMMENDED)
Real-world precipitation data often contains missing values. Use the professional-grade data filling module to handle gaps:

- **Linear interpolation**: For 1-2 day gaps
- **Climatological normals**: For 3-7 day gaps using seasonal averages from other years
- **Analogous year method**: For 8+ day gaps using meteorologically similar years

The data filler follows best practices used by professional hydrologists and meteorologists, including statistical validation and quality control.

### 3.3 Run PrecipGenPAR
Once you have the time series (preferably with missing data filled), you can run the preprocessor, `PrecipGenPAR`. This requires a configuration file that points to a CSV file containing the daily precipitation data. When you run `PrecipGenPAR`, you need to load the time series. The JSON file should have a reference to the path to this file.

### 3.4 Generate Input Parameters
After initializing a new simulation, use a function in `PrecipGenPAR` to generate the input parameters. These parameters will be used as input to `PrecipGen`.

### 3.5 Execute a Simulation
To execute a simulation, you need the start and end dates, which are defined in the JSON file. The simulation starts on the start date and walks forward in time one day at a time. During each update, `PrecipGen` calculates a new output, which is the rainfall for the day. This continues until the end date is reached.

### 3.6 Results
When the simulation is complete, the results are stored in a text file as a time series of daily precipitation over the long term. Another text file contains annual and monthly totals and statistics.

### 4.5 Data Filling for Missing Values

Real-world precipitation data often contains missing values due to equipment failures, maintenance periods, or data transmission issues. The PrecipGen PAR tool includes professional-grade data filling capabilities that follow meteorological best practices.

#### Usage:

```sh
# Basic data filling
python cli.py fill-data input_data.csv -o filled_data.csv

# Advanced options
python cli.py fill-data input_data.csv \
  --max-gap-days 30 \
  --min-similarity 0.7 \
  --seasonal-window 15 \
  --min-years-climatology 10 \
  -o filled_data.csv
```

#### Filling Methods:

1. **Linear Interpolation (1-2 day gaps)**
   - Simple linear interpolation between adjacent values
   - Most appropriate for very short gaps
   - Ensures smooth transitions

2. **Climatological Normal (3-7 day gaps)**
   - Uses seasonal averages from other years
   - Considers Â±15 day window around target date
   - Preserves seasonal patterns

3. **Analogous Year Method (8+ day gaps)**
   - Finds meteorologically similar years
   - Based on seasonal precipitation patterns
   - Uses correlation analysis for year selection

#### Quality Control:

- Statistical validation of filled values
- Preservation of seasonal patterns
- No negative precipitation values
- Extreme value detection
- Comprehensive quality report generation

#### Output Files:

- `*_filled.csv`: Data with missing values filled
- `*_filling_report.json`: Detailed filling statistics and validation

#### Example Output:
```
Data Filling Summary:
Original missing values: 45
Final missing values: 3
