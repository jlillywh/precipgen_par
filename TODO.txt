Method Naming: Ensure method names are intuitive and self-explanatory.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to provide meaningful error messages.
Examples: Include usage examples in the documentation to demonstrate how to use the class and its methods.
Dependencies: Clearly state any dependencies and how to install them.
